## Our Methodology

CloudWaze Cloud Consulting methodology summarizes the four stages of offering you the tailored cloud solutions:

### 1. Cloud Assessment
Also known as the cloud readiness assessment – it is a method of assessing your existing IT resources' merit (incl. SWOT – strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) for migration to the cloud which involves detailed identification of the enterprise applications, infrastructure, and the associated components that span between them.

### 2. Cloud Migration Design
In this stage, CloudWaze employs all the intelligence gathered during the assessment and implements them into designing a deployment plan. One of the popular procedures in the cloud migration design is the use of move groups approach, in which all the applications and dependencies are strategically segregated for migration.

### 3. Cloud Deployment
The next stage of procedures comprises the final migration execution in line with the previously designed cloud migration strategy. This stage can simply be termed 'cloud migration in action', however, a much fascinating component in the cloud deployment stage is the continuous improvement of the process during the runtime.

### 4. Operate
Upon a successful deployment, the operate stage comes into effect. This stage necessitates the continuous monitoring and optimization of the new assets – cardinal for extracting the estimated performance, business value, and return on investment.
